# Binary Clock

A simple binary clock using LEDs and a Raspberry Pi Pico W.

For a quick demo, you can [play with a virtual version on Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/389796647886494721) -- in the circuit area, press the green triangle button to start the program running and the grey square to stop it again.
