# Binary Clock

A simple binary clock using LEDs and a Raspberry Pi Pico W.

For a quick demo, you can [play with a virtual version on Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/389796647886494721) -- in the circuit area, press the green triangle button to start the program running and the grey square to stop it again. 

> **Note**: In the above Wokwi demo, the WiFi access simulation for the Pico W does not currently function. Parts of the code relating to this are commented out and labelled. It does mean you will have to manually update the RTC in the code to reflect your local time.
